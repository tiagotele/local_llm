Steve Jobs was an American entrepreneur and co-founder of Apple Inc., born in 1955 in San Francisco, California. He is widely recognized as a visionary in the tech industry, leading the creation of revolutionary products like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac computers. Jobs co-founded Apple in 1976 with Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, and the company quickly became a leader in personal computing. After being ousted from Apple in 1985, Jobs founded NeXT, a computer platform development company, and acquired Pixar, which became a major player in animated films.

In 1997, Jobs returned to Apple, revitalizing the company and steering it toward groundbreaking innovations. His keen eye for design and focus on user experience helped make Apple one of the most valuable companies in the world. Jobs passed away in 2011, but his legacy lives on through the products and values he instilled in Apple and the tech industry as a whole.
