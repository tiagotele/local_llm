Abraham Lincoln was the 16th President of the United States, serving from 1861 to 1865, and is widely regarded as one of America’s greatest leaders. Born in a log cabin in Kentucky in 1809, Lincoln rose from humble beginnings to become a self-taught lawyer and a powerful orator. His presidency was marked by the Civil War, during which he worked tirelessly to preserve the Union and end slavery. In 1863, he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, a landmark executive order that began the process of freeing enslaved people in Confederate states.

Lincoln’s leadership during the Civil War helped to bring about the eventual abolition of slavery with the passage of the 13th Amendment. Tragically, he was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth in April 1865, just days after the war’s end. Lincoln’s legacy endures as a symbol of unity, freedom, and perseverance, with his life and presidency leaving an indelible mark on American history.
