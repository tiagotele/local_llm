Linus Torvalds is a Finnish-American software engineer best known as the creator of the Linux operating system kernel, which he first released in 1991. Born in Helsinki, Finland, in 1969, Torvalds began his journey with computers at a young age. While studying computer science at the University of Helsinki, he began developing Linux as a free, open-source alternative to UNIX. Over time, Linux grew into a robust operating system kernel, forming the backbone of countless servers, desktops, and embedded systems worldwide.

Torvalds also developed the popular distributed version control system Git, which is widely used by developers today. His work on Linux and Git has profoundly impacted the software industry, championing the principles of open-source development and collaboration. Torvalds continues to oversee the Linux kernel, guiding its evolution and influencing the open-source community globally.
